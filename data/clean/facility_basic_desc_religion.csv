Every year we help thousands of people live at home for longer – enriching the lives of individuals and entire families each day.



We visit people's homes to help with everyday tasks such as cooking, cleaning or vacuuming. We’re often called upon for clinical nursing care. But sometimes we come for nothing more than simple companionship.



At Benetas, we don’t let red tape slow us down or hold you up in accessing quality home care services. We’re often able to start providing home care within 1-4 days of agreeing to services, and can even offer same day service in cases of emergency.



Our people are truly committed to the work they do. They respect, value, and appreciate the people they care for, forging strong bonds and friendships. Many speak foreign languages and understand the sensitivities of different cultures.
